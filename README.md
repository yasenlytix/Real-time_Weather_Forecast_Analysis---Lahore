# **🎯 Problematic Crisis**

<br>

## ***❶ Weather Volatility & Planning Risk***
### Cities like Lahore experience unpredictable monsoon shifts — from sunny to instant thunderstorms in hours.
### Such volatility poses risks to construction timelines, transport logistics, public events, and general commuting.

<br>

- ### 

<br>

## ***❷ Air Quality Crisis & Public Health Concerns***
### Lahore has repeatedly ranked among the most polluted cities globally (e.g., CO level = 931, extremely hazardous).
### Heat, humidity, UV, and poor AQI can worsen health issues. Yet, there’s minimal integration of weather dashboards with healthcare planning in Pakistan.

<br>

- ### **This Dashboard raises awareness of these risks** (e.g., AQI = 931 CO 🚨).



<br>

## ***❸ Lack of Centralized, Real-Time Weather Data***
### Businesses and citizens rely on fragmented apps or foreign data sources that don’t update locally in real-time.

<br>

## ***❹ Poor Data Visibility for Non-Technical Stakeholders***
### Raw data from APIs is hard to understand for Non-Developers, Managers, Stakeholders, Healthcare Experts, and Non-Technical Decision Makers.

<br>

## ***❺ Need for Multi-City Weather Comparison***
### Many operations in Pakistan are spread across cities — such as Sialkot (textile), Lahore (urban), Karachi (port).

<br>

## ***❻ Unpredictable Rainfall Impacting Urban Operations***
### Rainfall directly impacts delivery delays, traffic congestion, waterlogging, and outdoor work.

<br>

## ***❼ Invisibility of Forecast Trends***
### People often rely on “today’s weather” only, without seeing the week-long trend (e.g., rising temps from Friday–Sunday).

<br>

## ***❽ Ignoring Daily Sunlight Timings***
### Knowing sunrise and sunset is essential for workers (site engineers, delivery teams), especially in energy-conscious routines.
