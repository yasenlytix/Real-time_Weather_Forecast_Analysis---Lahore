# **üéØ Problematic Crisis**

<br>

## ***‚ù∂ Weather Volatility & Planning Risk***
### Cities like Lahore experience unpredictable monsoon shifts ‚Äî from sunny to instant thunderstorms in hours.
### Such volatility poses risks to construction timelines, transport logistics, public events, and general commuting.

<br>

> - ### **The Dashboard shows daily rain probability (e.g., 100% for Fri‚ÄìSun), helping teams plan ahead.**

<br>

## ***‚ù∑ Air Quality Crisis & Public Health Concerns***
### Lahore has repeatedly ranked among the most polluted cities globally (e.g., CO level = 931, extremely hazardous).
### Most dashboards do not integrate AQI (Air Quality Index) with weather. Yet, this data is crucial for health, outdoor planning, and government advisories - especially in polluted cities like Lahore.
### Heat, humidity, UV, and poor AQI can worsen health issues. Yet, there‚Äôs minimal integration of weather dashboards with healthcare planning in Pakistan.

<br>

> - ### **The dashboard visualizes AQI levels (PM, CO, SO‚ÇÇ, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ) with colors and categories (e.g., Moderate, Unhealthy). Dashboard also raises awareness of these risks (e.g., AQI = 931 CO üö®).**



<br>

## ***‚ù∏ Lack of Centralized, Real-Time Weather Data***
### Businesses and citizens rely on fragmented apps or foreign data sources that don‚Äôt update locally in real-time.
### Most global weather platforms do not offer localized, visual, and city-specific data for regions like Lahore, Sialkot, or Karachi with regional UX in mind. Businesses struggle to make city-level decisions using generic platforms.

<br>

> - ### **The Dashboard integrates live API data, providing a local, instantly updated snapshot of weather essentials.**

<br>

## ***‚ùπ Poor Data Visibility for Non-Technical Stakeholders***
### Raw data from APIs is hard to understand for Non-Developers, Managers, Stakeholders, Healthcare Experts, and Non-Technical Decision Makers.
### Weather APIs often return complex JSON data, which is not human-readable for managers and non-tech stakeholders. This causes inefficiencies in using weather insights during day-to-day operations.

<br>

> - ### **By converting complex data into easy-to-read visuals (graphs, bars, icons), The Dashboard bridges the technical-to-human gap.**

<br>

## ***‚ù∫ Need for Multi-City Weather Comparison***
### Many operations in Pakistan are spread across cities ‚Äî such as Sialkot (textile), Lahore (urban), Karachi (port).
### Businesses working across cities (e.g., e-commerce, logistics) have no single platform to compare weather across key cities to align field operations.

<br>

> - ### **The dashboard enables quick switching & comparison between major cities to synchronize decision-making. The Dashboard allows side-by-side viewing of Sialkot, Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad and Faisalabad**

<br>

## ***‚ùª Unpredictable Rainfall Impacting Urban Operations***
### Rainfall directly impacts delivery delays, traffic congestion, waterlogging, and outdoor work.
### Lack of focus on rain probability prevents companies from managing resources (e.g., moving goods, changing delivery schedules, pausing construction) in advance.

<br>

> - ### **The Dashboard proactively displays rain % for the entire week, giving visibility to critical disruptions ahead.**

<br>

## ***‚ùº Invisibility of Forecast Trends***
### People often rely on ‚Äútoday‚Äôs weather‚Äù only, without seeing the week-long trend (e.g., rising temps from Friday‚ÄìSunday).

<br>

> - ### **I have inserted Forecast graph into the Dashboard. The forecast graph brings out pattern awareness, essential for longer-term scheduling or outdoor event planning.**

<br>

## ***‚ùΩ Ignoring Daily Sunlight Timings***
### Knowing sunrise and sunset is essential for workers (site engineers, delivery teams), especially in energy-conscious routines.

<br>

> - ### **The Dashboard have this minor but high-utility detail that many apps skip.**
